                    <h3>Run Buddy</h3>
                    <p>Run Buddy was built using a module from the Coding Boot Camp at The University of Texas at Austin. It utilizes advanced styling for multiple sections to match the provided mock up, including media queries to adapt for various screen sizes.

                    <h3>Recipe Finder</h3>
                    <p>A team of 3 developers created this website to simlify the process of finding a new recipe. Using buttons, users can search for recipes by either food type or dietary restrictions. They will get a random recipe name, image, ingredient list & link to full recipe, along with the total nutrition facts of the recipe. We used Edamam APIs to get the information & JavaScript including JQuery for the functionality. Additionally, we utilized the Bulma CSS framework for styling.</p>
