                    <h3>Recipe Finder</h3>
                    <p>A team of 3 developers created this website to simlify the process of finding a new recipe. Using buttons, users can search for recipes by either food type or dietary restrictions. They will get a random recipe name, image, ingredient list & link to full recipe, along with the total nutrition facts of the recipe. We used Edamam APIs to get the information & JavaScript including JQuery for the functionality. Additionally, we utilized the Bulma CSS framework for styling.</p>
