                <h2>Problem Solver.</h2>
                <p>I thrive on tackling tough issues all the way through by breaking down the problem & constantly asking why. During the day, I'm a process improvement & automation project manager at a large tech company, so I'm used to dealing with big, complex problems. Most of the time, I'm juggling multiple workstreams.</p>

                <h2>Data Driven.</h2>
                <p>I make decisions based on the facts and am always looking for concrete numbers to back up assumptions. In 2018, I graduated with a BBA in Data Analytics from Ohio University & use what I learned there every single day. If you're interested in learning more about my approach to data & visualizations, please read my undergraduate thesis project <a href="https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_olink/r/1501/10?clear=10&p10_accession_num=ouhonors1524826335755109">here</a>, where I explored an analytics backed approach to filling out March Madness brackets through bite-sized visualizations.</p>
